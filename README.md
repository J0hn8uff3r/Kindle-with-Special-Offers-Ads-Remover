# Kindle-with-Special-Offers-Ads-Remover
If you purchased a Kindle eReader with Special Offers Promotion this script will remove the ads showed when your device is locked (you dont have to pay 10 bucks in Amazon for it :D)

Jailbreak or root device it's not necessary, and warranty won't be voided cause it just remove the internal path where ads are stored.

# IMPORTANT NOTE: You must set plane mode after ads removal to avoid kindle redownload ads from wifi again, if ads appear just rerun the script
